resource levels to better understand the status of wsps who and iwa have undertaken a review of wsp  experiences globally in order to provide  a more complete picture of global wsp status wsp survey data were supplemented by other data sources where  available such as published literature this presents a demanding situation for independent surveillance which is often limited for  such systems risk assessment  and risk management approaches may range from operators of small systems regularly performing sanitary inspections to the  implementation of a full wsp 8 9 10 7 findings compare the number of countries that have implemented wsps based on the data available n 118 with the total number of countries in the relevant who region in this context several  countries have set targets for safe management regulations in bhutan the regulations to support the water act which took effect in 2015 require wsp implementation for all  water supply systems wsps in urban settings are also encouraged in cambodia s 2014 national drinkingwater quality  standards to date eight wsps have been approved and 39 are under revision out of 50 major water  utilities colombia s current drinkingwater regulations require all water utilities to implement  risk mapping  equivalent to water safety planning through health resolution 47162010 jamaica is working to introduce wsps  into regulations through the framework of the national water quality and surveillance plan representatives from brazil peru colombia chile ecuador and venezuela participated  in the workshop soon the

strengthen their wsps by addressing  improvement opportunities identified by dwi auditors study results are expected to be published by the end of 2017 the ia indicators and associated guidance and tools are being revised  to reflect lessons learned through the study 15 bangladesh bhutan cambodia cook islands lao people s democratic republic mongolia nepal philippines samoa sri lanka timorleste and vanuatu this finding reinforces an important  distinction between wsp development and active sustained wsp implementation in practice as exemplified in the  south african case study the wsp therefore identified an important  opportunity to improve water quality with minor financial inputs required 13 where national or subnational governments promote wsp implementation at scale eg through regulatory  requirements for wsps there are important cost implications in new zealand on the other hand  wsp training and auditing expenses are covered by government budgets annex c includes a
